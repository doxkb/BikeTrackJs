JavaScript is executed Just-in-Time and passed via a native bridge to the device. Tabris.js accesses native controls and does not depend on webviews to render the app's UI. As a result, the performance of the apps cannot be distinguished from apps developed directly in native code of the platforms.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo start developing Tabris.js applications, visit [tabrisjs.com](http://tabrisjs.com) and check out the \"[Getting Started](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/latest/getting-started)\" guide in the documentation. Be sure to also consult the code [snippets](https://github.com/eclipsesource/tabris-js/tree/master/snippets) and [examples](https://github.com/eclipsesource/tabris-js/tree/master/examples) in the Tabris.js Developer App (download from the app store for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsesource.tabrisjs2) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tabris.js-2/id1166468326?mt=8)).\n\n## Extensible\n\nTabris.js can be extended with [Cordova plugins](https://cordova.apache.org/plugins/) to add support for additional native features. A cordova plugin is also able to directly interface with the native widgets (as can be seen e.g. in the [tabris-plugin-maps](https://github.com/eclipsesource/tabris-plugin-maps)).\n \n Additionally [npm modules](https://www.npmjs.com/) can be used to further enrich the available JS APIs.\n\nTabris.js also adds support for many key web technologies including:\n- _Canvas_\n- _XMLHttpRequest / fetch()_\n- _WebSockets_\n- _localStorage_\n\n\n## Online build\n\nTo package your source into a installable app, Tabris.js features an online [build service](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/latest/build). There is no need to download a huge SDK or use specific hardware for development (e.g. a Mac machine to build for iOS). A [local build](https://tabrisjs.com/documentation/latest/local-build) is also available as an option if more customization is needed.\n\n\n## Build tabris npm module\n\nFollow these steps if you want to build the tabris module yourself.\n\nInstall the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) build tool using [npm](http://www.npmjs.com):\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g grunt-cli\n```\n\nIn the [tabris-js](https://github.com/eclipsesource/tabris-js) root directory fetch the dependencies and build:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\ngrunt\n```\n\n## License\n\nPublished under the terms of the [BSD 3-Clause License](LICENSE).\n",
